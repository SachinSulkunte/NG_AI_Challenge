# NG_AI_Challenge
Developed chatbot model capable of responding to several voice queries related to Covid-19. Designed for student-usage, specifically for college campus use. 

Integrated mask detection model ensures students are correctly wearing masks before utilizing the chatbot. Utilized web sockets to share data between two python programs to stop chatbot usage if a mask is not properly worn.
